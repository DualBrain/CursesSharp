Bugs:
	Handle symlinks in copy
		(A broken symlink breaks, we need to copy them, regardless of the targt)
	Error dialog box for broken symlinks show cancel button at the top
	Error dialog box for files is too short (5 chars)
	First char in the caption for an error is not inverted? [ Error ] (the first space is not the right color)

Features Missing:
	FUSE binding (instead of VFS)
	Subshell support
   
Panel:
	Display configurations (long, short, attributes)
	File coloring
	File kind marker
	Mini-status per file
	incremental-search
	Various commands
	Refresh

File Management:
   Show progress
   Compute ETA
   Copy:
       Copy special device files (pipes, sockets, devices)
       Support Overwrite yes/no/append;   For all targets: all/update/none/if size changes
   Rename, Move, Delete.
   Background operations       

Copy:
	Disable copying ..

Panel:
	Do not render .. on nested views

Viewer:
	Hex mode
	Formated mode (nroff pages, html pages)
	^H support for nroff pages
	Search
	Regex search
	Status bar

View:
	Bind this to F2?

	Offer options for files, for example foo.html:
	      [Raw]
	      [HTML rendered]
	      [DOM Rendered]

	For example, foo.exe:
	      [Raw]
	      [Hex]
	      [EXE/ECMA file rendering]
	      
Info Panel:
	Support per-file information browsers
		PE files: display PE headers
		NET files: display .NET dump, disassembly

	Since we are .NET program, we might as well add an assembly browser ;-)
